# TIC-80 & Lua Exercises

---

I recently got interested in learning the concepts of 2D game development and found out about Fantasy Consoles which are game engines that emulate the hardware and limitations of vintage gaming consoles from the 80s. There are a few popular ones like [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) & [TIC-80](https://tic80.com). I dectied to use TIC-80 to learn about the basic concepts of game development because it's free, it has a good documentation and a active community.
Since TIC-80 uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org) as its main language it gave me the chance to learn the capabilities of Lua as well.

First I red the documentation and reference book of Lua on the official website to get familiar with the language. ThenI moved on to read the TIC-80 documentation on the official GitHub Wiki.
After I was a bit familiar with Lua & TIC-80 I started to learn about basic concepts of 2D games such as movement, vectors, sprites, animation, collision detection & bounding boxes. With that I started to create a set of exercises, for some of which I used existing tutorials, to solidify my knowledge and understanding.
